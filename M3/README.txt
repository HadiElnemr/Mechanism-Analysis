You can open the "Final Plots.svg" file on Chrome for better experience.
The Analysis.mlx live script has the equations of the analysis. There is a PDF file for it.
The MATLAB Files folder contains the functions that compute the corresponding outputs of analysis.
The Main script that calls all functions and draw final plots is the "solve_machanism.m" script
